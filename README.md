# Routine Tracker

Routine tracker makes it easy to keep track of routines and habits, allowing users to create schedules, input the time spent on activities in a given day and view historical data. 
The app is flexible as you can pick and choose which features are applicable to your needs.

A live version of the app can be tested here:

## Features

This section will briefly demonstrate the main features of the app. 

### Activities

Here you can create activities which will be used throughout the website. Users can also customise colour schemes by clicking on the colour box.

### Schedule

This page helps users keep track of activities done on a regular basis. It does not have to be used in tandem with the log/history features if the user
desires. Timeslots are added to an overlay which sits on top of the schedule table. Users can hover over them for more info, or to delete them.

### Log

Users can input records here and see a history of the last month of records for their activities. The interface is colour coded, with darker colours representing more time spent on an activity on a given day. 

(*If the activity was created less than a month ago, the app displays the number of days since its creation*)

### History

This page offers a more extensive history when compared to the log page. Users can track their historial records onwards from when their activity was first created. 
The graph was created with ChartJS.
